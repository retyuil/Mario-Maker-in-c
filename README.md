Based on this repo : https://github.com/paolodelia99/mario-maker

But I did it in C and used SDL, you can create your map by modifying the text files in the map folder.

For blocks and ground the text file contain the x,y coordinates and the size of the blocks for the goombas.txt file it contains the x,y coordinate of each goomba
and the lower and upper bound for the goomba movements.

TO DO :
- ADD all the enemy of super mario bros (nes)
- ADD proper background customisation
- Create a GUI for creating the map
- Import sprites and enemy from different marios games
- Optimise the collision detection and the rendering.
